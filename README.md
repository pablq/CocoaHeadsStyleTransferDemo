# CocoaHeadsStyleTransferDemo
Small app to demonstrate basic Style Transfer Core ML feature.

I built this app as an excuse to try out Create ML and Core ML.

I also ended up trying out a Redux style architecture which is overkill for this tiny app, but was mega fun to learn and implement.

See the attached Keynote presentation for additional info including some helpful links.
