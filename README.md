# CocoaHeadsStyleTransferDemo
Small app to demonstrate basic Style Transfer Core ML feature.

I built this app as an excuse to try out Create ML and Core ML.

I also ended up trying out a Redux style architecture which was mega fun.

See the attached Keynote presentation for additional info including some helpful links.
